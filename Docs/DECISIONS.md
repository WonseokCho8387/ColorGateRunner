# Decisions

## Milestone 1

Status: Accepted

- A tap while Ready starts the run without toggling the initial Red color.
- Taps while Playing toggle the player color between Red and Blue.
- Gameplay input is ignored while Dead, but the restart button remains active.
- A gate resolves when the player crosses its one-shot trigger plane.
- Speed updates immediately after reaching scores 5, 10, 15, and so on.
- Restart reuses the configured seed.
- The initial seed is 12345.
- The deterministic pseudo-random number generator is xorshift32.
- Seed 0 is normalized to the fixed non-zero state `0x6D2B79F5`.
- Each xorshift32 step uses unchecked 32-bit unsigned arithmetic in this exact order:
  `state ^= state << 13`, `state ^= state >> 17`, `state ^= state << 5`.
- The least-significant raw bit maps to a gate color: `0` is Red and `1` is Blue.
- After applying the four-identical-color limit, the fixed first 32 gate colors for seed 12345 are:
  `Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Red, Red, Red, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Red, Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Blue, Blue`.
- The endless run has no finish condition in Milestone 1.
- Existing unused Unity packages remain unchanged during Milestone 1.
- Post-processing will be disabled when the graybox scene is implemented.
