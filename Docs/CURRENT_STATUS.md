Iteration 5

(Provided-item timing / high-speed progression correction complete)

Authoritative Iteration 5 Result

- `StageCatalog.asset` is the single production source for all 11 campaign
  stages. Runtime, simulation, and tests consume its pure-Core adapter through
  `IStageCatalog`.
- Clone gameplay has been removed. Echo is a modifier on an ordinary gate and
  does not add gates, positions, collision paths, or a second generator.
- Camouflage reveal uses effective-speed ETA, transitions once, never hides
  again, and always keeps ordinary judgment active.
- Stages 1-5 lock both start items in catalog data and the PreRun UI.
- Stage 6 provides one local Shield at start; Stage 7 provides one local
  Booster at start. Both activate after the same countdown boundary as an
  equivalent selected item, and the picker prevents duplicate selection.
- Player movement crossing an unresolved gate plane reuses the existing
  one-shot `TryResolveCrossing()` path. This prevents high-speed Booster
  movement from tunneling past the thin physics Trigger without adding a
  second judgment system or increasing the six-gate pool.
- Stages 8, 9, 10, and 11 teach Camouflage, Fog, Ice, and Echo respectively.
  Stages 6-10 use two active colors to isolate the new mechanic; Stage 11
  returns to three colors for the finale.
- Stage speed Start/Max/Curve, cadence, active color count, mechanic,
  Echo/Camouflage values, seed, and local grant are Inspector-authored.
- The stage picker is catalog-driven and contains 11 stable-ID buttons in a
  two-column portrait layout.

Final Validation

- EditMode: 249 / 249 passed.
- PlayMode: 128 / 128 passed.
- Stage 7 PlayMode starts Booster at `GO`, crosses all 40 planned gates at
  runtime speed, retains the fixed pool, and reaches Goal/StageCleared.
- The requested Stage 6-11 simulation subset contains 120 rows and 96,024
  modeled runs: six stages, five profiles, four item inputs, Perfect once and
  every stochastic condition 1,000 times.
- Stages 6 and 8-11 have zero changed rows versus the preceding campaign
  baseline. All 20 Stage 7 rows change only under the approved start-Booster
  contract.
- Stage 7 Average/None changes mechanically from first-clear
  `47.6% -> 47.0%`, Continue-clear `84.8% -> 95.1%`, median clear time
  `33.203s -> 31.356s`, and average Booster bypasses `9.780 -> 15.774`.
  These are not claims about fun or comfort.
- All 24 Stage 6-11 Perfect/item rows clear, and all 120 rows report zero
  Booster/Continue displacement, gate-index gap/duplicate, cursor reset, and
  full-pool reset violations.
- A fresh Step 10 run reproduced all five baseline hashes exactly.
- The full refreshed Stage 1-11 matrix is stored in the existing Mechanic
  Campaign artifacts.
- Core keeps `noEngineReferences: true`; no package or ProjectSettings feature
  change was introduced.

Stage Progression Hotfix

- Fixed a stale stable-ID reference in `ShowLobby()`. The lobby previously
  displayed the newly unlocked stage number but `PlayFromLobby()` could still
  start the prior stage ID.
- The displayed `StageDefinition.StageId` is now synchronized whenever lobby
  progression selects a stage.
- PlayMode explicitly verifies displayed Stage 2 starts Stage 2 and displayed
  Stage 3 starts Stage 3.

Test Build Tooling

- `Tools > Color Gate Runner > Test Builds` provides Android APK, WebGL,
  combined Android-plus-WebGL, and output-folder commands.
- Both platforms use the enabled `EditorBuildSettings` scenes and Development
  mode. Outputs stay under ignored `Builds/Test`; Android always produces an
  APK and restores the previous App Bundle setting afterward.
- Missing scenes, missing platform support, platform-switch failure, and
  unsuccessful `BuildReport` results fail explicitly instead of reporting a
  false success.
- Build-menu EditMode coverage passes 3/3 for the playable scene, platform
  targets, output paths, and Development option. The original editor compiled
  the new menu without errors and both installed platform modules were found.
- An isolated Android invocation reached the real Player build after script
  and shader compilation, but its copied-Library backend stopped making
  progress before producing an APK. WebGL was therefore not reached by the
  sequential command. Actual APK and browser output remain manual acceptance
  checks from the original editor.

Next Iteration

Use the new menus to create an APK and WebGL output from the original editor,
then perform human mobile/browser play. Verify Stage 7 Booster is visibly
active from `GO`, the first Booster gate cannot be skipped, the
provided/selected timing feels consistent, and the Stage 1-5 `LOCKED` labels
are understood. Continue the existing Echo, Camouflage, Stage 6-11 pacing,
Ice comfort, and finale review before another balance pass.

Current Decisions

Maximum Tap = 4

Mechanics unlock by Stage

Experiment uses deterministic stages

Experiment uses one explicit StageFlowState

Experiment Retry / Replay preserves condition and seed

Experiment never reads or writes campaign progress

Campaign speed and authored world distances scale together

Campaign cadence and approximate stage duration remain unchanged

Experiment Lab movement values remain unchanged

Echo uses ordinary gates and never changes gate count

Echo Camouflage uses ordinary ETA hide, reveal, and judgment

Echo offers are deterministic and non-stacking

Known Issues

Iteration 3 Clone Gate concept was rejected by human feedback and is
superseded by the approved Echo Modifier contract below.

Echo frequency, Echo/Shield readability, Camouflage reveal lead, and Stage
6–11 pacing require human mobile play.

Shield visual

Campaign 2x speed feel and comfort require human mobile playtest
