Iteration 6

(Flicker-only Experiment complete)

---

Previous Iteration 5 Result

- `StageCatalog.asset` is the single production source for all 11 campaign
  stages. Runtime, simulation, and tests consume its pure-Core adapter through
  `IStageCatalog`.
- Clone gameplay has been removed. Echo is a modifier on an ordinary gate and
  does not add gates, positions, collision paths, or a second generator.
- Camouflage reveal uses effective-speed ETA, transitions once, never hides
  again, and always keeps ordinary judgment active.
- Stages 1-5 lock both start items in catalog data and the PreRun UI.
- Stage 6 provides one local Shield at start; Stage 7 provides one local
  Booster at start. Both activate after the same countdown boundary as an
  equivalent selected item, and the picker prevents duplicate selection.
- Player movement crossing an unresolved gate plane reuses the existing
  one-shot `TryResolveCrossing()` path. This prevents high-speed Booster
  movement from tunneling past the thin physics Trigger without adding a
  second judgment system or increasing the six-gate pool.
- Stages 8, 9, 10, and 11 teach Camouflage, Fog, Ice, and Echo respectively.
  Stages 6-10 use two active colors to isolate the new mechanic; Stage 11
  returns to three colors for the finale.
- Stage speed Start/Max/Curve, cadence, active color count, mechanic,
  Echo/Camouflage values, seed, and local grant are Inspector-authored.
- The stage picker is catalog-driven and contains 11 stable-ID buttons in a
  two-column portrait layout.

Iteration 5 Validation

- EditMode: 249 / 249 passed.
- PlayMode: 128 / 128 passed.
- Stage 7 PlayMode starts Booster at `GO`, crosses all 40 planned gates at
  runtime speed, retains the fixed pool, and reaches Goal/StageCleared.
- The requested Stage 6-11 simulation subset contains 120 rows and 96,024
  modeled runs: six stages, five profiles, four item inputs, Perfect once and
  every stochastic condition 1,000 times.
- Stages 6 and 8-11 have zero changed rows versus the preceding campaign
  baseline. All 20 Stage 7 rows change only under the approved start-Booster
  contract.
- Stage 7 Average/None changes mechanically from first-clear
  `47.6% -> 47.0%`, Continue-clear `84.8% -> 95.1%`, median clear time
  `33.203s -> 31.356s`, and average Booster bypasses `9.780 -> 15.774`.
  These are not claims about fun or comfort.
- All 24 Stage 6-11 Perfect/item rows clear, and all 120 rows report zero
  Booster/Continue displacement, gate-index gap/duplicate, cursor reset, and
  full-pool reset violations.
- A fresh Step 10 run reproduced all five baseline hashes exactly.
- The full refreshed Stage 1-11 matrix is stored in the existing Mechanic
  Campaign artifacts.
- Core keeps `noEngineReferences: true`; no package or ProjectSettings feature
  change was introduced.

Stage Progression Hotfix

- Fixed a stale stable-ID reference in `ShowLobby()`. The lobby previously
  displayed the newly unlocked stage number but `PlayFromLobby()` could still
  start the prior stage ID.
- The displayed `StageDefinition.StageId` is now synchronized whenever lobby
  progression selects a stage.
- PlayMode explicitly verifies displayed Stage 2 starts Stage 2 and displayed
  Stage 3 starts Stage 3.

Test Build Tooling

- `Tools > Color Gate Runner > Test Builds` provides Android APK, WebGL,
  combined Android-plus-WebGL, and output-folder commands.
- Both platforms use the enabled `EditorBuildSettings` scenes and Development
  mode. Outputs stay under ignored `Builds/Test`; Android always produces an
  APK and restores the previous App Bundle setting afterward.
- Missing scenes, missing platform support, platform-switch failure, and
  unsuccessful `BuildReport` results fail explicitly instead of reporting a
  false success.
- Build-menu EditMode coverage passes 3/3 for the playable scene, platform
  targets, output paths, and Development option. The original editor compiled
  the new menu without errors and both installed platform modules were found.
- An isolated Android invocation reached the real Player build after script
  and shader compilation, but its copied-Library backend stopped making
  progress before producing an APK. WebGL was therefore not reached by the
  sequential command. Actual APK and browser output remain manual acceptance
  checks from the original editor.

Authoritative Iteration 6 Result

- Flicker is a flag on the shared ordinary-gate `GateModifier`. It adds no
  gate, generator, collision path, judgment path, or pool object.
- `FlickerSettings` validates the approved Inspector-authored fields. The
  Launcher converts its serialized values into the pure-Core settings and
  disables Booster for Flicker-only runs.
- The existing deterministic Experiment sequence selects stable Flicker gate
  IDs without changing color/spacing PRNG output, gate count, or Step 10.
- A pure-Core visibility state requires both minimum readable time and shared
  effective-speed ETA, starts one transition, and never reveals target
  information again before judgment.
- The pooled View begins with target color/symbol plus a persistent `FLICKER`
  identity. Hide blends to the existing neutral silhouette and removes only
  target symbol information; geometry, judgment opening, transform, collider,
  and marker remain.
- Player, held Echo, Shield, and ordinary failure reuse the existing priority.
  Retry/Replay reproduce selection and reset visibility state.
- Campaign Stages 1-11 and the 16-condition Step 10 matrix are unchanged.

The initial Flicker settings are Inspector-authored human-play candidates:
eligible progress `0.15-0.85`, chance `0.35`, cooldown `2`, visible duration
`1.00s`, hide lead `0.65s`, transition `0.12s`, maximum `4`, and guaranteed
first occurrence. Booster is disabled for this standalone condition.

Iteration 6 Validation

- Original open Editor: scripts compiled without C# errors.
- EditMode: 262/262 passed.
- PlayMode: 134/134 passed.
- Scene Builder: the command's two consecutive builds succeeded; the rebuilt
  isolated scene then passed PlayMode 134/134 again.
- Campaign simulation: 220 rows and 176,044 modeled runs. Summary, JSON, and
  CSV hashes are byte-identical to the preceding baseline.
- Step 10: all five CSV/JSON/summary/comparison/shortlist hashes are
  byte-identical to the approved baseline.
- Packages and ProjectSettings have no intended feature change. Automated
  results do not establish Flicker readability, comfort, comprehension,
  fairness, satisfaction, motivation, or fun.

Next Iteration

After automated validation, perform Flicker human play on portrait mobile and
browser builds. Record concept recognition, observation duration, hide timing,
memory interval, transition clarity, retained gate position, Echo/Shield
comprehension, portrait readability, and repeat-entry fatigue before changing
balance or expanding scope.

Current Decisions

Maximum Tap = 4

Mechanics unlock by Stage

Experiment uses deterministic stages

Experiment uses one explicit StageFlowState

Experiment Retry / Replay preserves condition and seed

Experiment never reads or writes campaign progress

Campaign speed and authored world distances scale together

Campaign cadence and approximate stage duration remain unchanged

Experiment Lab movement values remain unchanged

Echo uses ordinary gates and never changes gate count

Echo Camouflage uses ordinary ETA hide, reveal, and judgment

Echo offers are deterministic and non-stacking

Known Issues

Iteration 3 Clone Gate concept was rejected by human feedback and is
superseded by the approved Echo Modifier contract below.

Echo frequency, Echo/Shield readability, Camouflage reveal lead, and Stage
6–11 pacing require human mobile play.

Shield visual

Campaign 2x speed feel and comfort require human mobile playtest
